        <span>Cookbook is side project born out of my passion for web development and my journey with Symfony PHP.</span>

         <p>As a student in web development, <span>Cookbook serves as my pet project</span> â€” a sandbox for me to hone my skills and explore the world of web development.</p>
        
        <p>Cookbook is not just a website; <span>it's a virtual kitchen where I experiment with Symfony PHP and learn the ins and outs of creating dynamic web applications</span>. <br>
        Here, users can register, create, and publish recipes, also add recipes to a favorite list, simulating a real-world scenario in a controlled environment.</p>
        
        <p><span>While Cookbook may not be a real-world application, it represents countless hours of learning and dedication poured into mastering Symfony PHP</span>. Through Cookbook, I aim to showcase my progress and share my enthusiasm for web development with others.</p>
        
        <p>So, whether you're here to browse recipes or simply curious about the world of web development, welcome to Cookbook. Join me on this journey of learning and discovery as I continue to refine my skills and build towards the future.</p>
